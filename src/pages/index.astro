            Hey there, Nice of you to drop by! My name is Josh (AKA Stumpy) and
            this is my personal dev blog. In here, you will find stories of my
            personal life & tech journey. I believe in being open with others,
            even to a fault, and I wanted to share my life and maybe help a few
            people feel less lonely in their journey. Spread a lil' of that
            #relatable, if you know what I mean.
          </p>
          <p class="max-w-80">
            Now that the introduction is out of the way, you&apos;re probably
            wondering what I am getting out of this (or maybe not, I don&apos;t
            know for sure)... Well, personally, this blog serves 2 goals:
            <em
              >1: Give me the ability to look back and go, "Huh, that was really
              dumb of me..." and 2: Share some knowledge with you all from a
              different perspective
            </em>
            ...and that&apos;s about it I guess. Just remember, if you&apos;re not
            a <i>10x Engineer</i>, are you even doing it right?
